VS Code Notes
-------------

Run `java clean` command in the VS Code command palette to clean up "Cannot find ..." errors after adding a new build dependency (i.e: you added a new spring library to your maven/gradle file).

Use of the following extensions is highly recommended:
  * `Spring Boot Tools`
  * `Spring Boot Initializr Java Support`
  * `Spring Boot Support`
  * `Spring Boot Dashboard`

Note: all can be collectively downloaded via the `Spring Boot Extension Pack` (which bundles all 4 together).
